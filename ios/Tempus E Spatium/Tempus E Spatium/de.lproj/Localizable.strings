Quiz types include: Drag and drop the national flags to the right continent, listen to the national anthem and choose the correct flag, and complete the word. Despite the name of the app, the last type can be of any question type.\n\nThe questions are timed five seconds each (three on hard difficulty). If a player did not answer in time, he or she will lose 5 points.\n\nThe year range of the Date Game varies by difficulty, too (Hard: 20 years; Insane 50 years; Hysterical 100 years)!";
